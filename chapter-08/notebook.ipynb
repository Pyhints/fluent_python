        "- Static Typing and Bug Detection: Static type checkers can help find and fix many bugs in large codebases more cheaply than if the bugs were discovered only after the code is running in production. However, automated testing was widely adopted long before static typing was introduced.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Limitations of Static Typing: Static typing cannot be trusted as the ultimate arbiter of correctness. It can produce false positives (reporting type errors on correct code) and false negatives (not reporting type errors on incorrect code).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Loss of Expressiveness: If we are forced to type check everything, we lose some of the expressive power of Python. Some handy features can’t be statically checked, like argument unpacking (config(\\*\\*settings)), and advanced features like properties, descriptors, metaclasses, and metaprogramming are poorly supported or beyond comprehension for type checkers.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Lagging Behind Python Releases: Type checkers can lag behind Python releases, rejecting or even crashing while analyzing code with new language features.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Inability to Express Common Data Constraints: Type hints are unable to ensure certain data constraints. For example, they can’t ensure “quantity must be an integer > 0” or “label must be a string with 6 to 12 ASCII letters.” In general, type hints are not helpful to catch errors in business logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Type Hints and Software Quality: Given these caveats, type hints cannot be the mainstay of software quality, and making them mandatory without exception would amplify the downsides.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Static Type Checker as a Tool in CI Pipeline: A static type checker should be considered as one of the tools in a modern Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, along with test runners, linters, etc. The point of a CI pipeline is to reduce software failures, and automated tests catch many bugs that are beyond the reach of type hints.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Strong Typing vs. Strong Testing: The title and conclusion of this section were inspired by Bruce Eckel’s article “Strong Typing vs. Strong Testing”. He was a static typing advocate until he learned Python and concluded that if a Python program has adequate unit tests, it can be as robust as a C++, Java, or C# program with adequate unit tests (although the tests in Python will be faster to write).\n"
